I am interested in understanding life at the small scale of biological molecules like protein, DNA and RNA. What iterests me about this aspect of the natural world is that it is both simple and complex enough to engage with a large bredth of my academic training: biological physics, math bio, optimization, digital signal processing, computational statistics, evolutionary biology, philosophy of nature, biosemiotics. there is also a diversity of observational measurement and intervention techniques at this scale like microscopy, spectroscopy, biochemical assays, and mutagenesis. Finally, because of the generality of these perspectives, there are many possibilities to use our wisdom and forsight to contribute to care for our common home through downstream applications to health, medicine, agriculture, and materials science.

If you are curious about how experience and engage with the world, I invite you to read some of my writing:
