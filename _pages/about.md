I am interested in understanding life because it connects our own being with the rest of the natural world. I focus on the small scale of biological molecules like protein, DNA and RNA; which are simple and also complex enough to engage with a large bredth of my formal and informal training: biological physics, math bio, optimization, digital signal processing, computational statistics, evolutionary biology, philosophy of nature, semiotics. At this scale we can observe and intervene through experimental techniques like microscopy, spectroscopy, biochemical assays, sequencing, mutagenesis, and chemical design. through expressing the measurment process itself in the form of mathematical relationships, including numerical simulators, we can put scientific models in dialogue with data and refine our knowledge in a semiotic spiral. Such general perspectives have more immediate applications in health, medicine, agriculture, and materials science; but more broadly are an opportunity to use our wisdom and forsight to care for our common home and live in harmony with the cosmos.

If you are curious about how I experience and engage with the world, I invite you to read some of my writing:
